## **Introduction**

The **Comprehensive Privacy Guide** was established in January 2015 to provide an accessible resource for individuals to remove their personal data from data brokers, people search websites, and related entities. As privacy concerns continue to rise, this guide serves as a valuable tool for managing personal information and minimizing exposure to unnecessary data collection.

The guide was last updated on January 1, 2025, and includes additional websites such as Best History Websites that aggregate personal data. The most recent update in April 2025 removed BackgroundAlert following its closure after a settlement with the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA).

# **Requesting Blur on Online Map Services**

Street-level imagery platforms such as Google Street View and Apple Look Around often display houses, vehicles, license plates, and even people.

Below is a comprehensive guide to requesting blurring across major mapping platforms.

## **Google Maps**

**Supports manual blur requests for:**

- Faces
- License plates
- Homes and buildings
- Vehicles
- Other personal property

#### How to Submit a Blur Request:

1. Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
2. Enter the address or search for the location.
3. Drag the yellow **Pegman** (bottom-right corner) onto the map to activate **Street View**.
4. Navigate to the image you want to blur.
5. In the bottom-right corner of the image, click **"Report a problem"**.
6. Use the red box to center the object (e.g. house, license plate) you want blurred.

   - What to blur: face, house, license plate, or other.
   - A short explanation (e.g. ‚ÄúMy home, privacy concerns‚Äù).
8. Complete the CAPTCHA and submit the form.

**Note:** Once approved, the blur is **permanent** and cannot be undone.

üîó [Google Street View Blur Request Form](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3094088)

3. Tap the **info icon (i)** or **Report an Issue** button.

#### How to Request:

- Visit [Yandex Maps](https://yandex.com/maps) and locate the imagery.
- Use the **feedback** or **‚ÄúReport an error‚Äù** button on the image.
- Or contact Yandex support directly:
  üîó [Yandex Support](https://yandex.com/support/common/troubleshooting/main.html)

- **360Cities, MapQuest, DuckDuckGo Maps** ‚Äì These aggregate from partners (e.g. Google, Apple), so follow the primary source instructions.

## **Pro Tips**

- üì∏ **Take a screenshot** before submitting the blur request in case you need to reference the original image.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Processing time**: It may take a few days to several weeks for changes to take effect.
- üîÅ **Follow up**: If your request isn‚Äôt acted on within a month, resubmit or escalate via email.
- üßæ **Provide clear context**: For best results, include details like street address, object description, and image orientation.

By blurring your home, vehicle, or other identifying details, you reduce the likelihood of doxxing, targeted scams, or unwanted attention.

# **Global Privacy Laws & Regulations**

This section provides an overview of the most important global privacy laws and regulations that protect your personal data. Understanding these laws is essential to knowing your rights and how to take control of your data.

## üá∑üá∫ Russia

- **Federal Law No. 152-FZ on Personal Data**  
  Also known as the **Personal Data Law**, this law governs the collection, storage, and processing of personal data within Russia. Adopted in 2006 and amended over time, it requires organizations to obtain explicit consent from individuals for processing their personal data and mandates that data be stored within Russia‚Äôs borders (data localization requirement). Non-compliance with the law can result in fines and sanctions.

  Key aspects of the law include:

  - Data subjects‚Äô right to access, correct, and delete their personal data.
  - Organizations must register with the Russian data protection authority (Roskomnadzor) if they process personal data on a large scale.
  - Provisions regarding cross-border data transfer and data localization within Russia.
  - Companies must implement adequate security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.

# **How to Audit SDKs and APIs for Data Collection**

Before integrating any SDK or API, it‚Äôs important to understand what user data it collects, processes, and shares. Here‚Äôs how to evaluate that:

### 1. **Review Official Documentation**

- Look for "Privacy" or "Data Use" sections in SDK/API documentation.
- Check for references to:
  - PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
  - Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, Android Advertising ID)
  - Behavioral data (e.g., clicks, page views)

### 2. **Use Traffic Monitoring Tools**

- Analyze data transmitted by SDKs using:
  - **Charles Proxy**
  - **Wireshark**
  - **mitmproxy**
- Identify network requests made by the SDK or API to external servers.

### 3. **Static Code Analysis**

- Use tools like:
  - **MobSF** (Mobile Security Framework)
  - **Privado.ai**
  - **Exodus Privacy** (for Android APKs)
- Detect permissions requested and endpoints accessed by SDKs.

### 4. **Privacy Policy Matching**

- Compare what the vendor claims in their privacy policy vs. what the SDK actually sends. Be cautious of discrepancies.

### 5. **Open-Source Repositories**

- Check GitHub or GitLab if the SDK/API is open source.
- Look for tracking code, analytics hooks, or third-party integrations.

### 6. **Consult Community Feedback**

- Search Reddit, Stack Overflow, or GitHub issues for:
  - Privacy concerns
  - Data leaks
  - Compliance violations

### 7. **Ask the Vendor**

- Contact the SDK/API provider for a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) or a list of subprocessors.
- Request a copy of their latest security or privacy audit.

**Tip**: Consider using a privacy impact assessment (PIA) template before introducing any third-party SDKs into production environments.
